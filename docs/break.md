ðŸ”„ Reset Steps
Take a breather â€“ weâ€™ve clearly hit a point where fragmentation, truncation, and split-patching are causing more friction than help.

Next Session Ready â€“ when youâ€™re back:

Upload the full, latest static/app.js

Optionally re-upload your index.html if youâ€™ve patched modals locally

Let me know exactly which button/flow you want working next: +OAuth, pagination, token validation, etc.

Iâ€™ll return full files, split intelligently if needed, and weâ€™ll resume with clean context.

âœ… Current State Snapshot
static/index.html is mostly intact (modals are included).

static/app.js is partially uploaded in canvas (truncated at line 23, unusable).

Routes and backend appear solid (client.py, events_api.py, etc.).

Youâ€™re good to take a pause. When you return, weâ€™ll tackle the next item cleanly, with the full power of Skippyâ€”rearmed and reset.
