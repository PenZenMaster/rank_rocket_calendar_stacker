# Project Plan: Google Calendar Management Software

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the project requirements and implementation plan for an in-house software package designed to programmatically manage Google Calendar events. The primary goal is to replace the current reliance on a third-party vendor (therankingstore.com/calendar-stacker-factory) due to limitations in feature enhancements. The software will leverage the Google Calendar REST API and will initially be developed using Python, with consideration for alternative languages if necessary.

## 2. Project Requirements

### 2.1. Basic Requirements (User-Provided)

*   **Single User Operation (Initial Phase)**: The software will initially cater to a single user.
*   **Client-Specific Google Accounts**: Each client will be associated with one dedicated Google Account.
*   **CRUD UI**: A Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) user interface will be developed for managing calendar events.
*   **Data Validation**: Data validation will be performed during event creation and update operations to ensure data integrity.
*   **OAuth Credential Management**: The software must provide functionality to Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) OAuth credentials.
*   **OAuth Credential Validation and Refresh**: The ability to validate and refresh OAuth credentials will be a core requirement to maintain continuous access to Google Calendar APIs.

### 2.2. Suggested Requirements (Based on Guidelines)

To ensure the software meets high standards of quality and usability, the following additional requirements are suggested, aligned with the provided guidelines:

#### 2.2.1. Accuracy

*   **Event Data Integrity**: The software must accurately reflect all event details (e.g., title, description, start/end times, attendees, location) as intended by the user and as stored in Google Calendar. Any discrepancies must be immediately flagged and reported.
*   **Time Zone Handling**: The software must correctly handle time zones for event creation and display, ensuring events appear at the correct local times for all participants, regardless of their geographical location. This includes proper conversion between UTC and local time zones.
*   **Recurrence Rule Adherence**: For recurring events, the software must accurately apply and manage recurrence rules (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly, yearly, specific days of the week) as defined by the user, ensuring all instances are correctly generated and displayed.
*   **Attendee Management Accuracy**: The system must accurately add, update, and remove attendees from events, ensuring invitations and updates are sent correctly and attendee responses (e.g., accepted, declined, tentative) are reflected in the UI.
*   **API Response Interpretation**: The software must accurately interpret responses from the Google Calendar API, including success messages, error codes, and data structures, to ensure correct internal state management and user feedback.

#### 2.2.2. Reliability

*   **Error Handling and Reporting**: The software must implement robust error handling mechanisms for all interactions with the Google Calendar API and internal operations. In case of failure, meaningful and actionable information must be returned to the end-user, including specific error messages, potential causes, and suggested remediation steps (e.g., 


OAuth token expired, network issue, invalid event data). This information should enable the user to understand the problem and take corrective action without needing developer intervention.
*   **Retry Mechanisms**: For transient API errors (e.g., network timeouts, rate limits), the software should implement intelligent retry mechanisms with exponential backoff to ensure operations eventually succeed without user intervention. The number of retries and delay intervals should be configurable.
*   **Offline Capability (Consideration)**: While direct Google Calendar API interaction requires connectivity, consider a limited offline capability for viewing existing events or queuing changes to be synchronized once connectivity is restored. This would enhance user experience in intermittent network environments.
*   **Data Consistency**: Implement mechanisms to ensure data consistency between the local application state and the Google Calendar. This includes handling conflicts that may arise from simultaneous modifications (e.g., by another user or directly in Google Calendar).
*   **Robust OAuth Flow**: The OAuth credential management system must be highly reliable, ensuring that tokens are securely stored, refreshed before expiration, and re-authenticated seamlessly when necessary. Any issues with authentication should be clearly communicated to the user with instructions for re-authorization.

#### 2.2.3. Performant

*   **Responsive UI**: The user interface must remain responsive during API calls and data processing. Long-running operations should be executed asynchronously to prevent UI freezes.
*   **Progress Indicators**: For operations that may take time (e.g., bulk event creation, large data synchronization), the software must provide clear progress indicators (e.g., loading spinners, progress bars, percentage complete) to inform the user about the ongoing process.
*   **Time-to-Completion Estimates**: Where possible, the software should provide accurate estimates of time to completion for long-running tasks, enhancing user expectation management.
*   **Efficient API Usage**: Optimize API calls to minimize latency and resource consumption. This includes using batch operations where appropriate, fetching only necessary data, and implementing efficient data parsing.
*   **Local Caching**: Implement a local caching strategy for frequently accessed data (e.g., calendar lists, frequently viewed events) to reduce reliance on repeated API calls and improve perceived performance.
*   **Background Processing**: Offload non-critical or time-consuming tasks (e.g., extensive data validation, complex recurrence calculations) to background processes to maintain UI responsiveness.

#### 2.2.4. Scalable

*   **Multi-Client Support**: The architecture must inherently support multiple clients, each with their own Google Account and associated calendars. This implies a clear separation of client data and credentials.
*   **Multi-User Support (Future)**: While initially for a single user, the design should anticipate future multi-user access, potentially requiring user authentication within the application and role-based access control to client data.
*   **Concurrent Operations**: The software should be capable of handling simultaneous event creation, update, or deletion operations across different clients or calendars without performance degradation or data corruption. This will likely involve asynchronous programming and careful management of API rate limits.
*   **API Rate Limit Management**: Implement intelligent rate limiting and quota management for Google Calendar API calls to prevent exceeding limits and ensure continuous service availability. This might involve token buckets or leaky bucket algorithms.
*   **Modular Architecture**: Design the software with a modular architecture, allowing for easy addition of new features, integration with other services, and independent scaling of components (e.g., UI, API interaction layer, database).
*   **Database Scalability**: Choose a database solution that can scale to accommodate a growing number of clients, events, and associated data. Consider options that support horizontal scaling or sharding if necessary.

#### 2.2.5. Intuitive

*   **Clear UI/UX**: The user interface must be clean, uncluttered, and easy to navigate. All input fields, buttons, and interactive elements should have clear labels, tooltips, or contextual help to communicate their purpose and function.
*   **Consistent Design Language**: Maintain a consistent design language and visual style throughout the application to provide a cohesive user experience.
*   **Feedback and Confirmation**: Provide immediate visual feedback for user actions (e.g., successful save, error messages). Confirm critical operations (e.g., deleting an event) to prevent accidental data loss.
*   **Error Messages**: As mentioned under reliability, error messages should be user-friendly, specific, and actionable, guiding the user towards a solution rather than just stating a failure.
*   **Onboarding and Help**: Consider implementing an onboarding process for new users and providing accessible help documentation or tutorials within the application.
*   **Accessibility**: Design the UI with accessibility in mind, ensuring it can be used by individuals with diverse needs (e.g., keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility).

## 3. Technical Architecture and Implementation Plan

### 3.1. Language Choice: Python vs. Go

Based on the project requirements, particularly the emphasis on rapid development for the initial phase, extensive libraries for UI and API interaction, and the initial single-user scope, **Python is a suitable choice** for this project. While Go offers superior raw performance and concurrency for highly scalable backend services, Python's ecosystem for web development, UI frameworks, and ease of use for data manipulation aligns well with the current needs.

However, it is important to acknowledge that as the project scales to accommodate multiple users and simultaneous operations, the performance characteristics of Python (specifically the GIL for CPU-bound tasks) might become a limiting factor. In such a scenario, a hybrid approach or a migration of performance-critical components to Go could be considered. For the initial phase, Python's benefits outweigh these potential future limitations.

### 3.2. Proposed Architecture Components

The software will likely consist of the following key components:

*   **Frontend (UI Layer)**: A web-based user interface to interact with the application. This will provide the CRUD functionality for events and OAuth credentials.
*   **Backend (API/Logic Layer)**: A server-side application that handles business logic, interacts with the Google Calendar API, manages OAuth flows, and communicates with the database.
*   **Database**: A persistent storage solution for application data, including client information, OAuth credentials, and potentially cached event data.
*   **Google Calendar API Integration**: The core module responsible for all interactions with the Google Calendar API.

### 3.3. Detailed Implementation Plan

### 5.3. API Integration Layer

#### 5.3.1. Google Calendar API Wrapper

A dedicated Python module will encapsulate all Google Calendar API interactions:

```python
class GoogleCalendarService:
    def __init__(self, oauth_credentials):
        self.credentials = oauth_credentials
        self.service = self._build_service()
    
    def _build_service(self):
        # Build Google Calendar service with OAuth credentials
        pass
    
    def create_event(self, calendar_id, event_data):
        # Implement events.insert() with error handling
        pass
    
    def get_event(self, calendar_id, event_id):
        # Implement events.get() with caching
        pass
    
    def update_event(self, calendar_id, event_id, event_data):
        # Implement events.update() with validation
        pass
    
    def delete_event(self, calendar_id, event_id):
        # Implement events.delete() with confirmation
        pass
    
    def list_calendars(self):
        # Implement calendarList.list()
        pass
    
    def list_events(self, calendar_id, time_min=None, time_max=None):
        # Implement events.list() with pagination
        pass
```

#### 5.3.2. OAuth Management

A dedicated OAuth manager will handle the complete OAuth flow:

```python
class OAuthManager:
    def __init__(self, client_id, client_secret, redirect_uri):
        self.client_id = client_id
        self.client_secret = client_secret
        self.redirect_uri = redirect_uri
    
    def get_authorization_url(self, state=None):
        # Generate OAuth authorization URL
        pass
    
    def exchange_code_for_tokens(self, authorization_code):
        # Exchange authorization code for access and refresh tokens
        pass
    
    def refresh_access_token(self, refresh_token):
        # Refresh expired access token
        pass
    
    def validate_token(self, access_token):
        # Validate current access token
        pass
```

### 5.4. Frontend Architecture

## Phase 1: Project Bootstrapping and Setup

### ✅ Completed:
- Repository initialized and pushed to GitHub: [https://github.com/PenZenMaster/rank_rocket_calendar_stacker](https://github.com/PenZenMaster/rank_rocket_calendar_stacker)
- Directory structure organized using `src/` and `tests/`
- `Flask` application factory pattern implemented
- `pytest` configured with coverage reporting
- Basic test suite scaffolded and passing

## Phase 2: OAuth Routes, Models, and Unit Tests

### ✅ Completed:
- `OAuthCredential` model defined with required fields
- OAuth flow (`/authorize/<oauth_id>` and `/callback`) implemented using `google-auth-oauthlib`
- Routes registered under blueprint `oauth_flow_bp`
- Unit tests written for both `/authorize` and `/callback` routes
- Test isolation with `app.test_client()` and scoped SQLite test DB
- Warnings eliminated (removed `.query.get()` in favor of `db.session.get()`)
- Clean test teardown with `teardown_appcontext`
- Full test suite runs with 4 passing tests and 45% total coverage

## Phase 3: Calendar Integration Layer (**Next**)

### 🔜 Tasks:
- Implement Google Calendar Service Wrapper
  - `create_event`, `get_event`, `update_event`, `delete_event`, `list_events`
- Secure authenticated API interaction using stored `OAuthCredential`
- Integrate `googleapiclient.discovery.build` logic
- Handle credential refresh and token expiry
- Write unit tests with mocked Google API responses
- Achieve 90%+ test coverage for integration layer

## Phase 4: UI Restoration and OAuth Completion

### 🔜 Tasks:
- Reconnect working UI to Flask routes
