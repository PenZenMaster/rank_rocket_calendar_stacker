🧾 End-of-Session Checklist
Summarize Progress:

✅ You got Flask shell working and confirmed your schema

✅ Inserted a valid OAuth credential into the DB

✅ Confirmed the client ID/secret JSON matches the Google project

⚠️ Hit a 403 block due to test user config in Google Cloud Console

🧠 Identified next fix: double-confirm test user + “Save and Continue”

Preserve State:

Your DB (src/database/app.db) now has a working credential (ID 1)

The client_secret.json is correct and active

You’re queued to retry the OAuth dance next session

Skippy’s Parting Words:

Don’t forget to close DB Browser before restarting Flask!

You’re 1 click away from firing up the authorization flow

When you return, we test the OAuth, store tokens, and inject events
